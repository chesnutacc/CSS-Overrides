## IMPORTANT
__Make sure you *actually* go over the Rules and Community Guidelines__ for this repository. While I'm aware that most people are used to seeing and immediately ignoring any instructions that involve reading rules (or any other content longer than 2 sentences), __this has to be the exception__.

### Regarding Content
>We do not allow content or activity on GitHub that:
>- ...is sexually obscene or relates to sexual exploitation or abuse, including of minors
>
>*-From the [User Safety](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies#2-user-safety) section of<br />*
> &#160; *GitHub's [Acceptable Use Policies](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies)*

Due to the content on some of the sites this reisitory focuses on (either currently or eventually), it is __critically important__ that you understand the rules before you post *anything*, such as:
- Comments
- Issues
	- For those of you who are new to __GitHub__ (or any other *git-based* platform), it's important that you understand *GitHub Issues* don't *actually* have to about a problem. *Issues* can be...
		- Requests (e.g. requesting a new feature)
		- Suggestions
- New Code
	- Usually submitted by creating a [Pull Request](url)
	- Can also be posted in comments

## Global Repository Rules

__Take this as your one and only warning__ because, in order to protect this repository (and the account it's under), I can't afford to give second chances. Should you *actually* get a second chance, consider yourself incredibly lucky and take the warning that will come with it __*very*__ seriously.
