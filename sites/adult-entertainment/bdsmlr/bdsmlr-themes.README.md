# Overview

__Do not post *anything* anywhere in this repository without *reading the rules* first.__


## Regarding Community Guidelines

Before we get into it, I need to make it abundantly clear that the website this content is meant for *is __not__* "family friendly" and is certainly not for work. More importantly, that site's content- in fact, basically everything about it, *does not conform to GitHub's community guidelines*. Therefore, this repository (not just this "section" of it) has some rules that *will* be followed. Violations will be taken very seriously and, as a rule of thumb, you can assume that violators will be blocked/banned *immediately*.

__Take this as your one and only warning__ because, in order to protect this repository (and the account it's under), I can't afford to give second chances. Should you *actually* get a second chance, consider yourself incredibly lucky and take the warning that will come with it __*very*__ seriously.



## The Rules

The rules and guidelines, as well as *why* they're so strict (and important) can be found below.


### Before You Continue

If you haven't already, make sure you visit the following for the *all* the rules and guidelines:
- The __CSS-Overrides__ [Repository Rules](#repository-rules)
- [Community Standards](#community-standards)
    - Also see *site-wide* [GitHub Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines#what-happens-if-someone-violates-githubs-policies)
- [Contributing Guidelines](#contributing-guidelines)


### Specifically for `bdsmlr`

Once again, *do not post __anything__* until you have gone over the rules and guidelines for this repository- and in addition to those (above), the following rules/guidelines are *specifically* for anything regarding `bdsmlr`:


#### Do not post __*any*__ links to the site itself

If you know what `bdsmlr` is, you should already understand why, but if you don't...
- Any __fully-qualified__ URL from `bdsmlr` that is posted on GitHub will automatically generate a __hyperlink__ to the URL
    - __NOTE:__ While it is *technically* possible to post a URL *without* generating a hyperlink,<br />doing so in this repository __is *still* a violation__.
    - Workarounds for __hyperlink generation__ *are still against the rules*
    - you enclose it in backticks <kbd>`...`</kbd>
