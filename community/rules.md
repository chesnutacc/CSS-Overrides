# Global Rules

1. __*Never*__ Post [Fully Qualified URLs](#fully-qualified-urls)
	- All *Fully Qualified* URLs posted in GitHub comments, issues, etc. will *automatically* generate hyperlinks. These hyperlinks are analyzed by GitHub and will be flagged if the destination contains content that violates any part of [GitHub's Site Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy).
	- Even though you can [prevent automatic hyperlink generation](url) by posting the URL as a line of `code`, __doing so is still a violation of the rule__ so long as the destination's content violates any of GitHub's policies.
	- See __[FAQs](url)__ for information about referencing a blog/webpage without using the full URL.
2. Do __*not*__ post images or media containing __[sexually explicit](url)__ or otherwise [inappropriate content](#inappropriate-content)
3. Do __*not*__ request __[personal information](url)__.
	- The only universal exception to this is for __email addresses__.
	- If you choose to post *your own* personal *contact* information, you are doing so *at your own risk*.
	- For more information, see:
		- GitHub's [Acceptable Use Policies: Privacy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies#8-privacy)
		- GitHub's [Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement)
4. Do __*not*__ post *or request* __[sensitive information](url)__.
	- Sensitive Information can include (but is not limited to):
		- [Social Security Numbers (SSN)](url) (United States)
		- The [International Equivalent](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_identification_number) to a United States SSN
		- Photo(s) of one's Birth Certificate
		- [Goverment-Issued Photo ID](url) number, or photos of the ID card
		- Any kind of insurance information
		- Financial information (bank account numbers, credit/debit card details, etc)






## Violations

Violating any of the rules above can- and *usually will* result in the removal of content (e.g., the post you made containing the content violation), as well as...
- Your account being banned from accessing the repository
- Your account being disabled by GitHub
	- __NOTE:__ This process is *out of my hands* (and often automated).
	- Should your entire GitHub account be banned/disabled, that means *GitHub themselves* found you in violation of their policies revoked your access to their services.
	- You can [appeal this decision] and attempt to have your account reinstated- but the chances are slim if you violate Rule #2.
