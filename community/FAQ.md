#### Blogs

Rather than posting a [Fully Qualified URL](url) to a blog, consider using one of the following options:

##### Post the blog's [base URL](url)

Put simply, the [base URL](url) is what comes after the hosting website's [domain name](url), usually immediately after the [domain name ending] (`.com`, `.net`, `.co.uk`, etc)
- __Examples:__
	- If the [Fully Qualified URL](url) is:<br /> `https://blogsite.com/blog-name`
	- Then the *base* URL would be:<br /> `/blog-name`
	
If you feel the need to specify the *website* where the blog is hosted, do so by *only posting the site's __name__.

##### Post the blog's [subdomain](url)

Some sites use [subdomains](url) instead of a [base URL](url) to host blogs (among other things). A *sub* domain is what comes *before the domain name* in a URL (replacing `www.`).
- __Examples:__
	- If the [Fully Qualified URL](url) is:<br /> `https://blog-name.blogsite.com/`
	- Then the *sub* domain would just be:<br /> `blog-name`
		- *don't include the `.` before the domain name*
